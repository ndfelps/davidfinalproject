## LoL Resource

The goal of this project is to create a resource for League of Legends geared towards getting new players into the game. As it stands, League of Legends can be a very difficult game to get into as a new player.

## The Basics

The front page will feature information that will be more useful to new players than a lot of other websites offer. Most guides are designed for veteran players, trying to prepare for ranked play. Our guides will be designed for newbies, as an introduction to the game. The front or home page of the website will highlight guides for the free champions of the week. We will also feature a more general guide, that explains to new players what influence points, riot points, runes, masteries, and the Tribunal are.

All guides will be able to be favorited, rated, and commented on. Users will be able to register with an email address, facebook, or twitter, and link their summoner profile.

## Additional Plans

The front page will also feature a list of the top ten most popular champions. The champions that are most popular can change due to a variety of factors, whether it's a balancing patch or just a change in the meta, and it is important to help new players understand this. It may also help them decide on which champion they purchase first.

Eventually, we will track stats for each summoner, and offer feedback based on their performance in each game. The feedback will be automagically generated based on performance, and will offer a list of potential items that they should have purchased.

## Current known limitations.

Riot currently allows me only 10 requests every 10 seconds, up to 500 requests every 10 minutes. Because of this, I will try to keep as much information static as possible, so the most popular champions and free champion rotation will only be updated on a weekly basis.
